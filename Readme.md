As all the HDMI connectors on my TV are already filled, I planned to setup the Raspberry pi's as network only devices.
After flashing Raspbian Lite, the pi booted. Plug ethernet, get address from DHCP and voil√†!

Well...

Not really...

There is a wifi chip in there, let's setup wifi. And now let's add the ssh key so that I don't have to type in my password each time. And having a proper hostname would be nicer.

And now let's setup the two other devices :)  
  
That take some time, so to ease that process this script generate a raspbian image with all the required provisionning:

    ./raspbian-setup.sh image hostname network psk id_rsa.pub

image is the name of a raspbian image file (I used 2016-05-27-raspbian-jessie-lite.img)  
hostname will be the desired hostname  
network is the SSID of a wifi access point and psk is the key (wpa)  
id_rsa.pub is your ssh public key, you can generate one specific to this purpose with ssh-keygen

I used infos from the following site to mount the image:
